      <p>
        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
        is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
        example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
        its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
      </p>

      <p>
        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
        and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
        structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
        variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
        example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
          to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
          client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
          HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
          and page navigation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
          relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
          extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
          provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
          the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <p> This is my personal guide, made of things that I found interesting, or easy to forget abuot for example important concepts <br> of functional programming concepts/React JS stuff.

      Array.pop() </header>
    <p> I havent used it in my programming courses but it is interesting.
      <p />
      <code>
        var threeArr = [1, 4, 6]; <br>
        var oneDown = threeArr.pop(); <br>
        console.log(oneDown);
        console.log(threeArr);
      </code>
    <p>Actually the first log is the last element of the array, the second log is the array minus the popped out one.</p>
    <p>Shift() does the same thing but opposit deirectection it removes the first element</p>
